# Optical-Laser-Communcations_2023
CS-490 Senior Design Project Optical Laser Communication System

Vision Statement: Develop a low cost optical laser communication system to perform ground to Low Earth Orbit Communication. Integrate and test software across the receiver, transmitter, and on-board computer subsystems, leveraging the power of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The system aims to achieve a high data rate transmission. It will utilize commercial components carefully selected based on criteria such as power, weight, price, data rate, wavelength, beam divergence, and reliability. This integrated hardware and software solution will pave the way for efficient and reliable data transmission in the space communication domain.
